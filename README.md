# Creased_Membranes
This repository contains the scripts developed to obtain:

(i) the Wolfram Mathematica codes for the analytical solution of the deployment and surface accuracy of transversally creased membranes with one or multiple folds (folder "Analytical solutions");

(ii) the Abaqus FEA files to create the finite element models (folder "FEA models");

(iii) the Matlab scripts to run 2D digital image correlation for the experiments (folder "2D DIC code for experiments"). 



If using these codes for research, teaching or industrial purposes, please cite:
